## What is it?
A fun card game where the cards can pretty much do anything

### No I mean like what is this code
Oh yeah this code is (what we believe) the first time someone's tried to write an engine for this
game so you can play it virtually

### Oh that's pretty cool
~~You didn't actually think this~~ thank you!

## How do I run the code?
1. Clone this repository somewhere
2. Make sure you have Python 3.8 installed
3. Make a python virtual environment and activate it (my weapon of choice: `python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate` on -nix systems)
4. Run `python -m bwc.server`. That's it!

### Wow you really skimmed over the layout of everything, please tell me that
Ok so basically look at the documentation in the `APIs` directory

### How do I contribute cards
Look in the `bwc/cards` directory! There are lots of example cards, pick on and start copying its layout
